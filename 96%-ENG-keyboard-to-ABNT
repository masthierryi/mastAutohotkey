; KEYBOARD MAIN --------------
; set the PC kayboard layout to ABNT2, and use these modified keys
; some keys may look redundant, but its wise to me. when you put abnt2 in a eng keyboard, the ; key will turn on a ç key, but we I didn't want this, i really wanted the ; key, even in abnt2, so i put the ç on alt+c (maybe i'm a strage)

Ins::End ; turn the numeric insert key into End key 
	return
PgDn::Del ; turn PgDn into Del
	return

^RAlt::send, \ ;turn de Ralt into backslash
	return
SC027::send, {;} ;on eng kb is a ";" (on abnt its a "ç", so I turn back into ";")
	return
+SC027::send, : ;on eng kb is ":", same as ";" key (on abnt its a "Ç")
	return
SC035::send, / ;on eng kb is "/" (on abnt its a ";")
	return
+SC035::send, ? ;on eng kb is "?" (on abnt its a ":")
	return
RShift & Down::send, ^. ;"ctrl+." for overleaf compiling
	return
 
RShift & Up::send, ^; ;"ctrl+/" for overleaf commenting
	return
SC053::send,. ; "." on numeric keyboard to "." (on abnt its a comma)
	return

!SC02E::send, ç ;"Alt+c" into ç
	return
!+SC02E::send, Ç ;"Shift+Alt+c" into Ç
	return
